# Stray Ninja (Demo)

**Stray Ninja** is a top-down survival game prototype built in Unity. The player chooses between three distinct combat paths — **Sword**, **Shuriken**, and **Ninjitsu** — and fights off waves of increasingly difficult enemies. This project is part of a larger vision and currently serves as a polished gameplay demo.
